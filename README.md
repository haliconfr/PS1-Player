# PS1-Player
Spotify controller skinned as the PS1 CD player

Features:
- Discord rich presence showing album art, song title and artist name
- Custom album art for local files, compatible with rich presence as well
- Full spotify controls including skipping tracks, pausing and playing
- Timer showing current track time
- List of tracks in the current album, displayed how the PS1 would display CD tracks

To add custom album art, create a .txt file in the "custom" folder and put a link to your image.
I've put some examples in there already.

feel free to use any code for anything! no need for credit :)

There's a bug where the current track time won't be shown properly in Discord,
this is a bug with Discord's API as far as I can tell and should be fixed whenever the API is.
